# discordbotsERAHQ
This repository holds all of my Discord bot guides/code/etc.

Report bugs [here](https://forms.gle/w1muDWWjwMF8uT2w9). I don't check github that often so service will be faster that way.
Currently, the bots that I have open source are

LyricFinder (WIP)
MessageLimiter (WIP)
TTT (Tic Tac Toe)
